Compile DataPreparation so that all methods are present in the workspace. 

Before compiling and running each program the dataset directory needs to be 
updated. All datasets needed are included in the zip-file, but they are also
available on http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/ .

The application uses some libraries that need to be imported in R. See the code 
for more information.
